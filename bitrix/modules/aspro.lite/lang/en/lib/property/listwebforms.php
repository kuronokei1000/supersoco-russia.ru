1. General (from infoblock and web forms). Forms with the same character codes are displayed here. For example, \"Request a call\" with the symbolic code \"aspro_lite_callback\" is available in web forms and in forms on information blocks. When choosing such a form, the marketing window will work regardless of the setting of the types of forms on the site. <br /> <br />
2. Unique forms. If you created a new form or changed the symbolic code of an existing one, it will be displayed in a separate list under the heading \"Unique from infoblock\" or \"Unique from web forms\". When this form is selected, the marketing window will work if the form type matches the set type in the settings (documentation).";
